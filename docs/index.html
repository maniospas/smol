<p><em>A safe & fast low-level language.</em></p>

<p><i>Smoλ</i>  (pronounced like "small" but with "o" instead of "a") is a low-level language with fast zero-cost abstractions that are organized into fail-safe services.
Its core is tiny — really tiny! So tiny, in fact, that functions like printing and basic
arithmetic operations are externally implemented in the standard library with a direct-to-C++ interface.
Follow on <a href="https://github.com/maniospas/smol" target="_blank" title="repository">GitHub</a> to keep track of progress.</p>


<h1 id="quickstart">Quickstart</h1>

<h3>Setup</h3>

<p>Download <i>smoλ</i> from its <a href="https://github.com/maniospas/smol/releases/latest">latest release</a>
or build it from source by cloning the repository and running <code class="bash">g++ smolang.cpp -o smol -O2 -std=c++23</code>.
As you can see, the language is so lightweight that there is no need for a build system and its main executable consumes less than 300kB
... plus GCC or Clang. Ensure that both the <i>smol</i> executable and GCC are available in your system path.
</p>

<p>
A language server is provided as a VSCode extension named <i>smoλ (smolambda)</i>;
search for the symbolic transcription in the parenthesis, or get it from 
<a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=maniospas.smolambda">here</a>.</p>

<h3>What's interesting?</h3>
<p>Look at an example of how <i>smoλ</i> manages data structures:</p>

<pre><code class="language-smolambda">@include std

smo Point(i64 x, i64 y) -> @new
smo Field(Point start, Point end) -> @new

service main()
    p = Point(3,5)
    f = Field(1,2,p)
    print(f.start.x + f.end.y) // 6
    --
</code></pre>


<p>First, <code class="language-smolambda">@include</code> brings code from
other files with the <i>.s</i> extension. Paths are separated by dots.
For safety, includes cannot occur within definitions and make code directly accessible. Here we include the
<a href="#std">standard library</a>, mainly to help with printing. Nothing exciting yet.</p>

<p>Next are some so-called <i>runtypes</i>, declared by the <code class="language-smolambda">smo</code>
keyword. These merge the concept of types and functions, where <code class="language-smolambda">-></code>
returns a value or tuple. If variable names are part of the returned tuple, they can be accessed as fields
from the result. <code class="language-smolambda">@new</code> is a shorthand for
returning a tuple of all arguments. This is useful for declaring structural data without any functionality.</p>

<p>Write something like <code class="language-smolambda">p = Point(...)</code> 
to access all returned named variables using notation like
<code class="language-smolambda">p.x</code> and <code class="language-smolambda">p.y</code>.
Unpack the result as part of arguments to other runtypes. Arguments are always flat
(there is no tuple of tuples) and can be reinterpreted in various ways
as long as primitive types match. Safety options for this are presented later.</p>

<p>Put all main business logic inside a <code class="language-smolambda">service main()</code> definition.
Being a service means that errors occurring inside are "caught" while performing safe allocation and deallocation. 
Services are also intrinsically parallel, can call each other, and handle returned errors. But more on them later.
For now, the main service is the program and the <code class="language-smolambda">--</code> symbol at its end indicates no returns.</p>

<h3>Control flow</h3>

<p>
<i>smoλ</i> offers conditions and loops. These return values -or no values- to
designate an end. Below is an example of those, where arguments to conditions and loops must always evaluate to booleans.
The <code class="language-smolambda">else</code> branch of conditions is optional. 
</p>

<pre><code class="language-smolambda">@include std

service main()
    i = 0
    while(i&lt;10) 
        if(i%2) print("Even "+str(i)) --
        else print("Odd "+str(i)) --
        i = i+1
    ---- // ends `while` then `main` 
</code></pre>

<p>
There are no break and continue statements for loops because these can be emulated with other notation.
First, as a styling choice, do not indent conditions that run from a position until the end of the loop's
body but instead place. An example is shown below. This also shows how to break loops by returning multiple
steps back - an operating we call <i>uplifting</i> of return values. 
The syntax for uplifting is to prepend
<code class="language-smolambda">^</code> in the middle of returns. 
This operation is called <i>uplifting</i>. 
</p>


<pre><code class="language-smolambda">@include std

service main()
    i = 511
    while(i&lt;10)
        i = i+1
        if(i%7==0) ^- // break
        if(i%2==0)
            print(i)
    ------ // ends `if`, then `while`, then `main`
</code></pre>
    


<h1 id="smo">Runtypes</h1>

<p>Types and functions are the same thing in <i>smoλ</i>
and marked as <code class="language-smolambda">smo</code> followed by a name
and a parenthesis with some arguments.
We call the merged concept <i>runtypes</i>.
As an example, look at a definition from the standard library,
which also gives a taste of the C++ ABI:</p>

<pre><code class="language-smolambda">smo add(i64 x, i64 y)
    @body{i64 z=x+y;}
    -> z
</code></pre>

<p>This tells us that we are defining an integer addition runtype with the corresponding arguments.
When called from other code, the definition is inlined in an optimization-friendly way. For example,
despite the illusion of typing, everything consists of direct variable operations; under the hood, field access like
<code class="language-smolambda">f.start.x</code> is replaced with variables like <code class="language-smolambda">f__start__x</code>.</p>

<p>Return a value or tuple of values with <code class="language-smolambda">-&gt;</code>,
and use <code class="language-smolambda">@body</code> to write C++ code. The ABI is described
later, but for now notice that a basic scan is also made to expose primitive types from inside the ABI.
</p>
<p>
If you don't want to return anything, use <code class="language-smolambda">--</code>.
Return symbols form visual barriers that are easy to spot while remaining ... small.
Note that <i>smoλ</i> does not require semicolons becase boundaries are unique:
everything ends at return statements, at the end of file, or resides in-between
parentheses and commas.</p>


<h3>Mutability (call by reference)</h3>

<p>Runtypes are called by value,
that is, without internal computations affecting external arguments. You can make
calls occur by reference by prepending
<code class="language-smolambda">&</code> to variable names in the signature. In this case,
internal modifications are retained. Below is an example.</p>

<pre><code class="language-smolambda">@include std

smo inc(i64 &x)
    x = add(x,1)
    --

service main()
    x = 1
    inc(x)
    print(x) // 2
    --
</code></pre>


<h3>Currying</h3>
<p>Runtype calls accept currying notation that transfers a precomputed value to the first argument.
In general, runtypes are all first-class citizens of the language in that they cannot be set as variables.
The curry operator is <code class="language-smolambda">:</code> and can be chained. Furthermore, you can omit
parentheses if there is only one argument and you curry it. Below is an example, where this notation is used to
have as little nesting as possible.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-smolambda">@include std

service main()
    1:add(2):mul(3):print
    // equivalent to print(mul(add(1,2), 3))
    --
</code></pre>


<p>Currying lets <i>smoλ</i> avoid methods as fields, as the notation <code class="language-smolambda">obj:rt(args)</code>
is conceptually similar. Note that mutability should be explicitly declared if you want <code class="language-smolambda">rt</code>
to have side-effects.
</p>

<h3>Fields</h3>

<p>The assignment operator copies the outcome of function calls to variables.
However, only returned symbols can be accessed as fields and only if there are 
multiple of them packed into a comma-separated tuple.
For example, below the input variable <code class="language-smolambda">x</code>
cannot be accessed after computations conclude.
</p>

<p>We already saw that it may be convenient to unpack all runtype inputs with
<code class="language-smolambda">@new</code> to directly declare a structural type
without internal implementation.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-smolambda">@include std
smo multi_out(i64 x)
    xinc = add(x,1)
    -> xinc, x
smo single_out(i64 x)
    x = add(x,1)
    -> x

service main()
    p1 = multi_out(1)
    print(p1.x)        // 1
    print(p1.incx)     // 2
    p2 = single_out(1)
    print(p2)          // 2
    print(p2.x)        // CREATES AN ERROR
    --
</code></pre>


<h3>Overloading</h3>

<p>Overload runtypes that are structurally
different when converted to a flat representation of primitives.
Runtypes that are equivalent in their expansion into rimitives cannot be used 
as part of function signatures due to ambiguity. More on circumventing this issue later.
As an example, the following definitions come from the standard library.</p>

<pre><code class="language-smolambda">smo print(f64 message)
    @head{#include &lt;stdio.h>}
    @body{printf("%.6f\n", message);}
    --
smo print(i64 message)
    @head{#include &lt;stdio.h>}
    @body{printf("%ld\n", message);}
    --
smo add(i64 x, i64 y) @body{i64 z=x+y;} -> z
smo add(f64 x, f64 y) @body{f64 z=x+y;} -> z

service main()
    print(add(1,1)) // 2
    print(add(0.2,0.3)) // 0.5
    --
</code></pre>


<h3>Call by type</h3>

<p>
You might want to choose a runtype's version based on another without actually passing data. For example,
something different should be called based on the expected outcome. In those cases, you can skip
declaring variable names in signatures, and you can omit parenthesis-based argumets that would create dummy data.
</p>
<p>
Below is a segment of the standard library that shows how the correct version of
an evoked method is applied. Runtypes without
parentheses refer to zeroed out input data.
You can also use a value as reference - that would be ignored.</p>

<pre><code class="language-smolambda">smo not(bool x) @body{bool z=!x;} -> z
smo print(f64 message)
    @head{#include &lt;stdio.h>}
    @body{printf("%.6f\n", message);}
    --
smo read(i64)
    @head{#include &lt;stdio.h>}
    @body{i64 number = 0; bool success = scanf("%ld", &number);}
    if(success:not) @fail{printf("Invalid integer\n");} --
    -> number
smo read(f64)
    @head{#include &lt;stdio.h>}
    @body{f64 number = 0; bool success = scanf("%lf", &number);}
    if(success:not) @fail{printf("Invalid number\n");} --
    -> number

service main()
    x = read(f64)
    print(x)
    --
</code></pre>



<h3>Unions</h3>
<p>Sometimes, you want to define code that is automatically adjusted to different runtypes.
This can be achieved by declaring runtype unions, which are resolved to one of their
options. The resolution persists to dependent calls, create different ones for independence.
Unions are resolved during compilation and, like many features of <i>smoλ</i>, are zero-cost
abstractions. They can also unpack unions provided as arguments.</p>

<p>
For example, the <code class="language-smolambda">Type</code> union
below is determined to be <code class="language-smolambda">f64</code> while
calling <code class="language-smolambda">inc</code> to match the <code class="language-smolambda">Point</code>
argument and carries over to the internal
implementation. Therefore, the <code class="language-smolambda">f64</code> primitive is used for reading, constructing
a two-dimensional point, for casting the value of <i>1</i> to the appropriate type,
and calling the corresponding overloaded addition.
Unions account for overloads of their options up to the point
where they are defined.</p>

<pre><code class="language-smolambda">@include std

union Type(i64, f64, u64)
smo Point(Type x, Type y) -> @new
smo inc(Point &p)
    p.x = add(p.x, Type(1))
    p.y = add(p.y, Type(1))
    --

service main()
    value = f64:read()
    p = Point(value, value)
    p:inc()
    print(p.x)
    --
</code></pre>


<h3>Labels</h3>

<p>
The so-called <i>labels</i> are special builtins that 
you define as structurally equivalent to
only themselves. Adding labels to rutype arguments or
returns adds safety in interpreting results.
</p>
<p>Defining
a label is as simple as prepending any valid runtype name 
with <code class="language-smolambda">&</code>.
This includes prepending runtypes. Labels are zero-cost
abstractions in that most usage is optimized away by the
compiler but
</p>

<pre><code class="language-smolambda">@include std

smo Point(&Field, i64 x, i64 y) -> @new
smo Field(Point start, Point end) -> @new

service main()
    p = Point(2,3)
    f = Field(1,p,5)
    print(f.start.x + f.start.y) // 6
    --
</code></pre>





<h1 id="service">Services</h1>

<p>So far we have been writing <code class="language-smolambda">service main()</code> as the entrant
point of programs. Armed with the basics, we can now look at what that <i>service</i> keyword is all about. 
Functionally, services are runtypes with nameless returned values. That is, their returns are unpacked and 
can be parts of arguments normally, but do not accept field access because it would be either unsafe or create
hidden computational costs. More on why later</p>
<p>
Below is an example of declaring and calling a service. Syntactically, this is near-identical to working
with runtypes so that it's easy to change your mind as you write code. 
You will often not notice anything different.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-smolambda">@include std

service square(f64 x) -> mul(x,x)
service main()
    y = square(2.0)
    print(y)
    --
</code></pre>

<h3>Why services?</h3>

<p>Services are basically functions with multiple returns but no field access. 
So from the viewpoint of merging types and functions, they are a step backwards.
What's more, they cost a few additional operations per call, as they need to actually push the call 
to the stack and cascade
unhandled errors. So they are less efficient if you, say, call them millions of times per second.
</p>
<p>
That said, they have three distinct advantages:
a) they run independently and in parallel, b) they can call each other regardless of definition order, 
and even allow recursion (by comparison, simpler runtypes can only "see" previous runtype and service declarations), 
and c) they provide a compartmentalized execution environment that does not let internal errors escape.
</p>

<h3>Error handling</h3>

<p>
The last point means that, after calling a service within another one,
you need to consider how to handle prospective errors. The pattern discussed 
so far is to blindly unpacking results into further service and runtime calls.
This elegantly fails if an error was previously returned: the error is cascaded
through the call stack. All those services fail safely by deallocating resources. 
</p>


<pre><code class="language-smolambda">@include std

service square(f64 x) 
    fail("Don't wanna!") // manually fail
    -> mul(x,x)

service main()
    y = square(2.0)
    print(y)
    --
</code></pre>
<pre style="background-color: #222; color: white;">> smol main.s
Don't wanna!
Runtime error: `square y` contains an error
</pre>

<p>
You can check for the error code of errors by accessing them from the service's result per
<code class="language-smolambda">result.err</code>. By convention, error codes are skipped
when unpacking services, essentially reserving field access for error handling but retaining
usage in further code.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-smolambda">@include std

service square(f64 x) 
    fail("Don't wanna!") // manually fail
    -> mul(x,x)
service main()
    y = square(2.0)
    if(y.err:bool) print("Something went wrong") --
    else print(y) --
    --
</code></pre>
<pre style="background-color: #222; color: white;">> smol main.s
Don't wanna!
Something went wrong
</pre>


<h1 id="buffers">Buffers</h1>

<p>Handle dynamic memory with the special <code class="language-smolambda">buffer</code> runtype.
Think of this as a list where new data are pushed to the back and popped from the front. The
definition is part of the language and it is how one would handle functions with variadic inputs too. 
(<i>Variadic</i> is a fancy way of calling an arbitrary number of inputs.)
</p>

<p>Buffers are unpacked into other runtypes by consuming elements from their start.
However, unpacking feasibility is checked at runtime. Memory deallocation is safe, occurs
always -even if runtime errors terminate the service-
and is injected automatically by <i>smoλ</i>. Data are stored in buffers without
even primitive types and correct unpacking either relies solely on the programmer or on
safe runtypes that will be discussed later.</p>

<p>Buffer elements are unpacked from the front until no
more entries are required for desired runtype calls.
Popping is memory safe in that it smoothly fails any service
(e.g., <code class="language-smolambda">main</code>)
with an appropriate error message.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-smolambda">@include std

smo Point(i64 x, i64 y) -> @new
smo Field(Point start, Point end) -> @new

service main()
    buf = buffer(1,2,3,4,5)
    f = Field(buf)   // pops front
    print(f.start.x) // 1
    print(i64(buf))  // 5
    --
</code></pre>

<h3>Slicing</h3>

<p>
Buffers can be sliced to obtain a sub-view of elements. This happens irrespectively
of other operations applied on the original. Slices can be obtained from square brackets that either contain
their starting element as 
<code class="language-smolambda">u64</code> number,
or contain starting and non-inclusive end elements separated by <code class="language-smolambda">to</code>.
</p>

<p>
You can change the separing operator to <code class="language-smolambda">upto</code> to make the last element inclusive,
or <code class="language-smolambda">lento</code> to specify the number of elements in the sluce.
Below is an example of slicing. <i>All operations are near-zero-cost abstractions, 
with the exception that specifying an end also checks for bounds compared to the enclosing slice.</i>
</p>

<pre><code class="language-smolambda">@include std

service main()
    buf = buffer(0,1,2,3,4,5)
    slice = buf[1:u64 to 3:u64]
    print(slice:i64)        // 1 (pops front from slice)
    print(buf[0:u64]:i64)   // 0 (buf[0] is also a slice)
    print(buf:i64)          // 0
    print(slice:i64)        // 2 (slice remains unaffected)
    print(slice:i64)        // CREATES RUNTIME ERROR
    --
</code></pre>

<h3>Concatenation</h3>

<p>Normally, you can have a buffer as the last argument so that popping knows how many elements
it needs to consume. The language offers four operations for buffers:
<code class="language-smolambda">reserve</code> preallocates memory
(for optimization, otherwise size is doubled when needed),
<code class="language-smolambda">push</code> adds data at the end,
<code class="language-smolambda">copy</code> copies contents without
altering the original. Finally, <code class="language-smolambda">put</code> 
assigns runtype values to buffers.
i</p>


<pre><code class="language-smolambda">@include std

smo Point(i64 x, i64 y) -> @new

service main()
    buf1 = buffer(1,2)
    buf2 = buffer():reserve(2):push(3,4)
    buf = buf1
          : copy()
          : push(buf2.copy())
    // buf1 and buf2 are empty now
    p1 = Point(buf)
    p2 = Point(buf)
    print(p1.x) // 1
    print(p2.y) // 4
    --
</code></pre>

<h1 id="std">Std</h1>

<p>The standard library contains implementations for common programming needs.
Besides overloading pairswise numerical and comparison operators for basic arithmetic types and booleans, 
it also supports string handling.
</p>

<h3>Console</h3>
<p>Basic functionalies are introduced for the console, namely reading and printing. These support all escape characters
C++ can support, including ANSI codes for colorization. They have also been overloaded for integers, floats, and -as seen in the next
segment- strings. Reading failure fails the current service under <i>smoλ</i>'s guidelines that services should fail completely and rerun
instead of trying to recover from ivnalid states. Here's an example:
</p>

<pre><code class="language-smolambda">@include std

service main()
    success = false
    x = f64:read()
    print(x)
    --
</code></pre>

<h3>Strings</h3>

<p>Below is an example that demonstrates conversion from
basic builtin types to strings. Similarly overload <code class="language-smolambda">str(Type obj)</code> 
for custom types. Strings admit the following two optimizations under the hood to enable
very fast handling without creating excessive bloat when passed around:
a) they retain c-style strings for quoted characters, and b) they keep track of the first character
to enable fast comparison without going through heap data.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-smolambda">@include std

service main()
    i = 0
    while(i&lt;=10) 
        if(0==i%2) print("Even "+str(i)) --
        else print("Odd  "+str(i)) --
        i = i+1
    ---- // end while and main with no return
</code></pre>
