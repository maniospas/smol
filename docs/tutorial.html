<h1 id="hello-world">Hello world <a href="#hello-world" class="anchor-link">🔗</a></h1>

<p>
Let's take our first steps into programming with <i>smoλ</i> (pronounced like "small" but with "o" instead of "a"). 
I must mention that the language
is a bit atypical in that it simplifies a lot of traditional programming concepts while keeping the ability
to write very fast yet safe code. Some level of control is sacrificed in the process, but this means
that you do not need to worry too much about technical details.
</p>

<p>
To start using <i>smoλ</i>, download it from its <a href="https://github.com/maniospas/smol/releases/latest">latest release</a>.
Ensure that both the <i>smol</i> executable and GCC are in your system path. For code writing prefer VSCode
and install the smoλ (smolambda) extension to help with syntax highlighting. We are now ready to create and
run a first program! This tutorial will have source code followed by terminal commands to run it and outputs - execute those
commands in your operating system's terminal/console or on the terminal provided by VSCode.
</p>


<p>Save the source code file below as <i>main.s</i> and run the command <code>smol main.s</code>. This 
creates an executable file named <i>main</i> or <i>main.exe</i> whose name depends on the source file
and the extension depends on your operating system. The command also runs the program right away,
so you can easily test it. Assuming that everything was set up correctly, you will see "Hello world!" print on the console.
To only create an executable, an act that is called <i>compiling</i> in all languages that support it,
run <i>smol main.s --task compile</i>. </p>


<pre><code class="language-smolambda">// main.s
@include std.builtins

service main()
    print("Hello world!")
    --
</code></pre>
<pre style="background-color: #222; color: white;">> smol main.s
Hello world!
</pre>

<p>
We will now look at the anatomy of this first program. To begin with,
we have a line comment <code class="language-smolambda">// main.s</code>.
This starts with double slash and ignores the remainder of the line. In
general, it is useful to comment code so that we can remember what we
had in mind. But take care not to write too trivial comments that would
require a lot of effort to keep up to date as your code evolves.</p>

<p>
Next, we have the <code class="language-smolambda">@include std.builtins</code>
statement. This includes the contents of the file <i>std/builtins.s</i>
in our code. If the file cannot be found in your project, it is sought out among the files accompanying
the <i>smol</i> executable. By the way, <i>std</i> is a common naming convention
to refer to the standard library of programming languages. This has a lot of common
functionalities; in our case we import some builtin operations for printing and reading
from the console, and performing basic math (additions, multiplications, etc). The
word <code class="language-smolambda">print</code> encountered later is declared
in the builtins we just imported.
</p>

<p>Now we get to the mysterious <code class="language-smolambda">service main()</code>
declaration. In <i>smoλ</i>, services are basically chunks of code that perform a designated
task. Other services can ask them to run again for some inputs.
They are like normal functions of other programming languages, but also 
automatically handle safety details like memory and errors for you (more on this stuff later).
</p>

<p>After telling the language that we want to create a service with the
<code class="language-smolambda">service</code> keyword, we set a name as
well as comma-separated arguments inside parentheses <code class="language-smolambda">()</code>. 
We will talk about arguments in a bit, but our first service has none of them. By
convention, in most languages the entry point of programs is the service/function
called <i>main</i>. In other words, our program is just a call to the <i>main</i> service, 
which executes all the commands found there.</p>

<p>Now we get to the juicy part; the actual code we are running inside our services!
Basically everything else is preparation for allowing us to write said code.
We have two lines of code. Of these, <code class="language-smolambda">print("Hello world!")</code> 
calls <code class="language-smolambda">print</code> with a string (that is, text inside quotation marks)
argument. You may wonder whether print is also a service. 
It is actually a bit more lightweight - something we call a <i>runtype</i>. 
I will explain what that means in more detail later.
For now, let us skip the specifics and focus on the last line of code: <code class="language-smolambda">--</code>
marks the end of our service's implementation.
</p>


<h1 id="variables">Variables <a href="#variables" class="anchor-link">🔗</a></h1>

<p>Many programming languages are centered around the concept of variables that keep track of specific values.
For example, when computing the circumference of a circle as <code>2πr</code> the radius of the circle
<code>r</code> may be stored in a variable and the result in yet another one.</p>

<p>Contrary to math, programming variables represent a specific outcome of computations:
their values remain set once computed and do not change automatically upon each other's changes. 
In <i>smoλ</i>, declaring a variable
is as simple as starting from a name that consists of some combination of letters, numbers, or underscores and
and using the equality symbol <code class="language-smolambda">=</code> to assign the outcome of some expression 
or constant. Variable names cannot start with a number and may not contain two consecutive underscores (this is reserved
for some special cases and the language will complain if you use it arbitrarily). 
An example of setting and using a variable is shown below.</p>


<pre><code class="language-smolambda">// main.s
@include std.builtins

service main()
    message = "Hello world!"
    print(message)
    --
</code></pre>
<pre style="background-color: #222; color: white;">> smol main.s
Hello world!
</pre>

<p>Normally, you cannot reassign a new value to already set variables in <i>smoλ</i>. 
In many languages we say that such variables are <i>immutable</i>. To be able to
modify set values you need to prepend the name with the <code class="language-smolambda">&</code>
symbol the first time you assign a value to it. It seems a bit bothersome to explicitly
declare which variables can be modified, but the reasons will become more obvious as we
progress through this tutorial; immutability brings logic safety and helps prevent many errors. 
Conversely, you need to pay special attention to variables marked for modification 
as they could be modified by called functions. An example of mofifying values is shown below.</p>

<pre><code class="language-smolambda">// main.s
@include std.builtins

service main()
    &message = "hello"
    print(message)
    message = "world"
    print(message)
    --
</code></pre>
<pre style="background-color: #222; color: white;">> smol main.s
hello
world
</pre>


<p>So far we only worked with printing some strings. But there are more types of
values built in the language and its standard library - the standard library is a collection
of helper implementations that usually comes alongside languages to extend their base functionality
with common operations. You will also be able to 
define more types of variables later to give structure to complicated data. For 
now, let us see some basic types.
</p>

<p>
First are integers, which are represented by writing some digits, like <code>0,42,128</code>.
These can be the subject of binary arithmetic operations like <code>+-*/%</code>, where the last one is the
modulo operator. By default, integers in <i>smoλ</i> are represented with 64 bits and are <i>unsigned</i> in that
they are non-negative. For example <code>...0010</code> in binary corresponds to the number <code>2</code>.</p>

<p>This type is commonly known as <code class="language-smolambda">u64</code>
and being the default makes it convenient to work with memory
while avoiding a whole host of errors that arise when considering signs. 
If an operation is invalid, for example if a larger unsigned integer
is subtracted from a smaller one like <code class="language-smolambda">0-1</code>
or if there is a division by zero, the current service immediately fails. Below is an 
example of working with unsigned integers.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-smolambda">// main.s
@include std.builtins

service main()
    x = 2
    y = 3
    print("Integer division of 2/3")
    print(x/y)
    --
</code></pre>
<pre style="background-color: #222; color: white;">> smol main.s
Integer division of 2/3
1
</pre>

<p>In many applications you will need to work with negative integers too, which in <i>smoλ</i> are often
represented with <i>signed</i> 64-bit representations referred to as <code class="language-smolambda">i64</code>; 
the sign is indicated by the first bit, but negative numbers
are stored in what is known as two's complement. Explaining this is perhaps too much detail for this tutorial, but if
interested in details you can visit the Wikipedia entry <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement">here</a>. 
Unsigned integers can represent numbers 
<code class="language-smolambda">0 upto 2^65-1</code> but signed ones
can represent numbers <code class="language-smolambda">-2^64 upto 2^64-1</code>.</p>

<p>
Signed integers have the same available operations as unsigned ones, with the bonus that any subtraction is valid.
However, you can not natively represent them. Instead, convert to unsigned counterparts to signed ones
by calling <code class="language-smolambda">i64(value)</code> or, with an equivalent notation that we will explain
later <code class="language-smolambda">value:i64</code>. A similar call can convert back the representation per 
<code class="language-smolambda">u64(value)</code>. Below is an example of how to yield minus one. It is deliberately
a bit harder to work with negative numbers in this language by making it very explicit because they can be
very hard to debug if we are not careful. For example, you might accidentally add a negative number in some computation
where you would not consider that possible.
</p>


<pre><code class="language-smolambda">// main.s
@include std.builtins

service main()
    minus_one = 0:i64-1:i64
    print(minus_one)
    --
</code></pre>
<pre style="background-color: #222; color: white;">> smol main.s
-1
</pre>

<p>
We next visit floating point numbers. Raw numbers are designated by adding
a dot to separate between the integer and decimal part. For example, <code>3.14159</code> is a floating point
number. Again, 64 bits are used to hold the repsentation, this time following the IEEE 754 standard, which
is typically accurate to 15-17 significant digits and <i>smoλ</i>. 
The float type is called <code class="language-smolambda">f64</code>
and there exist similar conversions between that and signed and unsigned integers. These conversions may lose
information. Importantly, <code>0</code> is an unsigned integer and <i>not</i> a float; 
its float counterpart is <code>0.0</code>. 
</p>
<p>
Notably, the IEEE 754 standard allows invalid operations like
division by zero and lets them yield positive infinity, negative infinity, or <code>NaN</code> (not a number) values.
You can check for those properties by correspondingly calling one of <code class="language-smolambda">isinf,isnan</code>.
Lack of native error checking from the standard results in performant floating point code. 
Of course, nothing stops you from creating
safe variations of the float type that are as fast as possible while failing when NaN would be computed.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-smolambda">// main.s
@include std.builtins

service main()
    x = 2.0
    y = 3.0
    print("Float division of 2/3")
    print(x/y)
    print("Is float division of 2/0 an infinity?")
    print(isinf(2.0/0.0))
    --
</code></pre>
<pre style="background-color: #222; color: white;">> smol main.s
Float division of 2/3
1.5
Is float division of 2/0 an infinity?
true
</pre>

<h1 id="conditions">Conditions <a href="#conditions" class="anchor-link">🔗</a></h1>

<p>
The last example also contains a check of whether some property is <code class="language-smolambda">true</code>
or <code class="language-smolambda">false</code>. This is called a boolean value, or <code class="language-smolambda">bool</code> 
for short. Boolean values usually hold comparisons. Numeric types also implement 
comparisons like <code>&gt;</code> (greater than), <code>&lt;</code> (less than), 
<code>&gt;=</code> (greater than or equal to), <code>&lt;=</code> (less than or equal to), 
<code>==</code> (equal to), and <code>!=</code> (not equal to). These evaluate to boolean values.


The last two are also implemented for boolean values themselves. Below is an example
</p>

<pre><code class="language-smolambda">// main.s
@include std.builtins

service main()
    print("Is 2 less than 3?")
    answer = 2&lt;3
    print(answer)
    --
</code></pre>
<pre style="background-color: #222; color: white;">> smol main.s
Is 2 less than 3?
true
</pre>


<p>
In programming you can dynamically determine which of your programm's commandσ run. This is known as the <i>control flow</i>.
The most common -and default- control flow is to just call one command after the other. But you can also
have conditional execution that changes which program segment is executed next, depending on some boolean value. In <i>smoλ</i>, the
syntax for this is <code class="language-smolambda">if condition case_true --</code> 
or, to also consider the alternative, <code class="language-smolambda">if condition case_true -- else case_false --</code>. 
The text <code>case_true</code> and code>case_true</code> can in turn be any sequence of commands. Notice that each
case is terminated with the same <code class="language-smolambda">--</code> symbol as the service's ending. In general, this symbol
declares the end of the current block of code so that previous control flow can resume. Increase the indentation of each code block
to make it easy to visually recognize them.
</p>

<p>
Below is an example that prints yes/no depending on some boolean condition. For fewer lines of code, merge <code class="language-smolambda">--</code> 
with other statements of control flow syntax, such as more copies of the same symbol or <code class="language-smolambda">else</code>. 
Look how multiple copies of the symbol forms a nice visual barrier at the end of the <i>main</i> service. This is a unique
feature of this language with an added bonus for good code writing: if you cannot easily tell how many blocks are ending,
you have probably created overcomplicaed code that should be simplified, for example by being split into more manageable segments.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-smolambda">// main.s
@include std.builtins

service main()
    print("Is 2 less than 3?")
    if 2&lt;3
      print("yes")
    ----
</code></pre>
<pre style="background-color: #222; color: white;">> smol main.s
Is 2 less than 3?
yes
</pre>

<p>
Conditions are also language expressions in that they may compute to a value.
The syntax mentioned above does not compute any such value, but you can replace 
<code class="language-smolambda">--</code> with <code class="language-smolambda">-></code>
followed by an expression to return the latter's outcome. In this case, the 
<code class="language-smolambda">else</code> segment is mandatory, and both
segments should return the same type of value. This is needed because <i>smoλ</i>
follows the so-called <i>static typing</i> paradigm, in which the type of every value
needs to be known at compile time. There are some dynamic features, like buffers
that hold data whose type changes while programs run, but this introductory tutorial
is not the proper place to learn about those.
</p>

<p>
An example of returning from a conditional statement is presented below. That also
demonstrates usage of the <code class="language-smolambda">elif</code> keyword, which
basically translates to the sequence <code class="language-smolambda">else->if</code>.
All cases return a string, otherwise the language would complain that they
do no return the same type.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-smolambda">// main.s
@include std.builtins

service main()
    x = 1.0-2.0
    sgn = if   x&gt;0.0 -> "positive"
          elif x&lt;0.0 -> "negative"
          else       -> "zero"
    print(sgn)
</code></pre>
<pre style="background-color: #222; color: white;">> smol main.s
negative
</pre>

<p>
As a final note on conditions, and to keep code easy-to-read, 
it is fine to return the outcomes of computations that do not yield any value, 
as long as you do not assign the outcome to a variable. For example, the pattern  
<code class="language-smolambda">if x&gt;0.0 -> print("positive")</code> is acceptable. Read that as 
<i>if x is greater than zero end the statement with the outcome of printing "positive"</i>.
</p>


<p>A variation of conditions are loops. Those keep executing a code block as long
a condition, which is re-evaluated on each loop, stays <code>true</code>. They take
the form <code class="language-smolambda">while condition case_true --</code> but 
they cannot have a return value. Below is a simple loop that prints the integers <code>0,1,2,3,4</code>
by starting from a zero-valued variable and continuously incrementing it. Recall that <code>&</code>
before a variable's first assignment allows its value to be modified. Again, the closing
<code class="language-smolambda">--</code> are merged in one line to create compact code. 
</p>


<pre><code class="language-smolambda">// main.s
@include std.builtins

service main()
    &i = 0
    while i&lt;5
        print(i)
        i = i+1
    ----
</code></pre>
<pre style="background-color: #222; color: white;">> smol main.s
0
1
2
3
4
</pre>

<p>
There is often the need for control flow to also terminate its parent
flow. In typical languages you can do this with <code>break</code> statements
or ways to pre-emptively stop functions/services. In <i>smoλ</i> there is 
a mechanism called <i>uplifting</i> that proives a lot of control but is not completely
free so that it is easy to recognize the exit point of each block. 
</p>
<p>This mechanism
consists of prepending <code class="language-smolambda">|</code> to the return statements
of code blocks, for example in the form of <code class="language-smolambda">|--</code> 
or <code class="language-smolambda">|-&gt;</code>. Below is an example of uplifting that prematurely
ends a loop under a certain condition. You can have multiple
levels of uplifting to end/return further upwards in the nested block hierarchy.
</p>



<pre><code class="language-smolambda">// main.s
@include std.builtins

service main()
    &i = 0
    while true
        print(i)
        if i==5 |--
        i = i+1

<h1 id="arguments">Arguments <a href="#arguments" class="anchor-link">🔗</a></h1>

<p>Moving on, let's see how we can declare
and call services and the more lightweight runtypes. 
The two share most of the interface, with runtypes being more lightweight by
zero-cost abstractions over performant machine instructions. But they do need
to be enclosed in larger services that create clear compartmenization of where
error messages can be intercepted. The reason why <i>smoλ</i> uses the term
<i>runtypes</i> instead of declaring that these are simple inlineed functions 
(that is, whose code is "copy-pasted" by the language when called) will be presented later.
</p>
<p>
As a glimpse on safety, memory that is reserved for operation outcomes, such as keeping
a vector of numbers, is automatically deallocated only at points when services come at an end,
but not when runtypes conclude. There are ways to control deallocation, but these are
too advanced to tackle in this tutorial. Controlling where memory is allocated and deallocated
is required by security-critical software, where milliseconds of overhead while waiting for
the operating system to grant the memory could incur huge penalties (delayed responses by 
vehicle safety systems or medilcal equiment malfunctions).
</p>

<p>Adding arguments to a service is as simple as adding a list of comma-separated
variable names. However, those variable names need to be prepended by their type
so that the service can know what inputs to expect. 
For example, <code class="language-smolambda">f64 x</code> denotes a service input
variable that is a float named <code>x</code>. To declared a runtype, change the 
<code class="language-smolambda">service</code> keyword to <code class="language-smolambda">smo</code>.
</p>

<p>
To call a service or runtype, you need a comma-separated list of input arguments, which are matched to variables in its arguments
based on the order in which they are provided.
Place inputs in a parenthesis next to the service name, and the latter will run and give you back a result, if any.
Below is an example that adds two floats and multiplies the result with a third one.
Since the return statement is very simple and does not require any intermediate computations, we
put it at the same line as the service. Otherwise, for visual clarity, indent the contents of 
services as we have done so far.
</p>

<p>
Services and runtypes may return no value to their caller, in which case they end with <code class="language-smolambda">--</code>,
or they can return a value, in which case they end with <code class="language-smolambda">-></code> followed by an 
expression that computes the value to be returned. This corresponds to return statements of other languages,
but is also the same notation for all other code blocks in control flow. Returns can declare and return types, but returning
will be addresse in the next section.
</p>


<pre><code class="language-smolambda">// main.s
@include std.builtins

smo affine(f64 x, f64 y, f64 z) -> (x+y)*z
service main()
    result = affine(1.0, 2.0, 3.0)
    print(result)
    --
</code></pre>
<pre style="background-color: #222; color: white;">> smol main.s
9.0
</pre>

<p> Up until now, arguments have been passed by value. This means that they cannot be
modified inside the service. However, <i>smoλ</i> 
also allows passing arguments by reference, making modifications to propagate back to the caller. 
To do so, prepend the argument name with an <code class="language-smolambda">&</code> in the parameter 
list of the service. This makes the internal variable mutable, and must be matched by mutable inputs, 
since they would not be modifiable otherwise. Below is an example, where
the variable <code>x</code> in <i>main</i> must also be marked as mutable - the language
would complain otherwise.</p> 

<pre><code class="language-smolambda">// main.s
@include std.builtins
  
smo update(f64 &x) 
    x = x + 1.0 
    -- 
service main() 
    &x = 2.0 
    update(x) 
    print(x) 
    -- 
</code></pre>
<pre style="background-color: #222; color: white;">> smol main.s
3.0
</pre>
<p>You can also provide types (instead of values) as arguments, without attaching them to variables or values. 
This is useful when you want to operate on a family of types generically, for example when you want a specific output. 
To pass a type, just use its name as an argument. Below is an example that creates a different </p> 

<pre><code class="language-smolambda">// main.s
@include std.builtins
  
smo zero(f64) -> 0.0
smo zero(u64) -> 0
service main() 
    x = zero(f64) 
    y = zero(u64) 
    print(x) 
    print(y)
    --
</code></pre>
<pre style="background-color: #222; color: white;">> smol main.s
0.0
0
</pre>

<p>
This is an oportune moment to learn how you can read from the console too; the standard library implements a <code>read</code>
runtype.
</p>

<p> Currying allows for chaining runtype and service calls in a way that mimics method dispatch. When using the
<code class="language-smolambda">:</code> operator, the left-hand-side becomes the first argument of the next runtype or service. 
This keeps code compact and easy to read, especially when chaining operations. Below is an example, which demonstrate
the advantage of currying in chaining service or runtype calls.</p> 
<pre><code class="language-smolambda">// main.s
@include std.builtins
  
smo triple(f64 x) -> x * 3.0 
service main() 
  print(2:f64:triple) 
  --
</code></pre> 
<pre style="background-color: #222; color: white;">> smol main.s
6.0
</pre>

<p>The currying notation also extends naturally to loops. If you curry into <code>while</code>, this is transferred as the 
first argument of the condition, enabling a pattern like <code class="language-smolambda">range(n):while next(u64 &i)</code>, 
where the variable <code>i</code> is defined and incremented according to the standard lbirar'y implementation
<code class="language-smolambda">smo next(range self, u64& i)</code>, 
where the state holding the current progress and ending condition is provided by <code>range</code>.
Getting the next state also returns a boolean value of whether the loop goes on.</p>

<p>Currying into loops is an expressive yet safe pattern of iterating through values. This is why constructs like <code>range</code>
are commonly known as <i>iterators</i> across programming languages. Importantly, iterators do not allocate memory for each element, 
but are responsible from generating a next state from the current one.</p>

<p>
Uplifting also works when returning from services. Below is an example where the absolute value
is computed by the programming pattern of returning early from running code.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-smolambda">// main.s
@include std.builtins

smo abs(f64 x)
  if x&lt;0.0 |-> 0.0-x
  -> x
service main()
    x = 0.0-1.0
    absx = abs(x)
    print(x)
    print(absx)
    --
</code></pre>
<pre style="background-color: #222; color: white;">> smol main.s
-1.0
1.0
</pre>

<p>A final feature of services is that they compartmenize code to execute safely; any errors do not immediately
stop execution at the place where services are called, but leave you the opportunity to handle what happens in the event of failure.
Errors will cascade into becoming the calling service's errors only if you do not handle them.
For example, if there are no error checks, the whole program terminates on the first error. 
Handling errors consists of checking whether
<code class="language-smolambda">result.err:bool</code> is <code>true</code>, in which case you should avoid using
the result variable further down the line. The field <code>.err</code> is automatically added to all services, but 
is ignored (after a check that they have not failed) when treating them as tuples.
</p>

<p>
Error messages are printed in the console, and typically start with <code>Error:</code>. You may trigger an error
manually with a string message per <code class="language-smolambda">if condition -> fail("Error: custom message here")</code>.
Errors immediately interupt the calling service, though any resources like open files or memory in use are automatically
released. This is what makes <i>smoλ</i>'s services to execute, even in long-running programs.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-smolambda">// main.s
@include std.builtins

service affine(u64 x, u64 y, u64 z) -> (x+y)/z
service main()
    result = affine(1, 2, 0)
    if result.err:bool |-> print("We failed to execute the code")
    print(result)
    --
</code></pre>
<pre style="background-color: #222; color: white;">> smol main.s
Error: division by zero
We failed to execute the code
</pre>
